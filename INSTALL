unsort-0.1

Change directory to the src folder
edit the Makefile to reflect whether you have

clock_gettime() 	-DHAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME=1

or failing that whether you have

getpid()		-DHAVE_GETPID=1

This is to adequately seed random(). The one second resolution of time() means
if a number of unsort processes are started in quick succession the output from
random() will be the same for each of those processes.
As a consequence if these unsort processes are are started with the same input
the output from each will be the same.
